This is new file a.txt
using command prompt
in which we publish our data un guthub server(REMOTE) after doing 2 3 change in our file 

in this we have to perform some git command to add the into server
so that it will all the change which is done so far

git remote add <name> <url>
name is equal to repositary name, just like origin which is the default name of master branch
url of the server in which it is store
by doing this, our local repositary will connect to github server,but it is not push

git remote -v 
to know the connection

git remote add -u <name><branch.name>
name which we select above
and branch name, either it is master or any other
so this will update our remote libary, what changes we made earlier

other step are the previous one that we do to update our local and remote repositary
